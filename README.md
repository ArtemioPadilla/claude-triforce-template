A 3-agent development system (PM / Dev / QA) that applies checklist methodology from *The Checklist Manifesto* (Atul Gawande) and Boeing's checklist engineering (Daniel Boorman) to AI-assisted software development. Built for teams and individuals who want structured, auditable, production-grade workflows — not ad-hoc prompting.

## Why Agent Triforce?

Most multi-agent systems focus on *more agents*. Agent Triforce focuses on *more discipline*.

- **Methodology over quantity** — 3 agents with 24 checklists (117 items) governed by the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist model, not 100+ generic agents with no coordination
- **Three mandatory pause points** — every agent invocation follows SIGN IN (before work), TIME OUT (mid-workflow verification), SIGN OUT (before handoff). Steps don't get skipped.
- **Engineering principles built in** — Clean Architecture, TDD, FIRST testing, and refactoring methodology are embedded into agent behavior, not left to chance
- **Persistent memory** — agents build on prior decisions across sessions. Context carries forward, not lost between invocations
- **Structured handoffs** — 6 defined communication paths between agents with explicit protocols (what was done, what to watch for, what's needed next)

## Install

### As a Plugin (add to any existing project)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add ArtemioPadilla/agent-triforce
/plugin install agent-triforce@agent-triforce
/agent-triforce:setup    # scaffold project directories
```

For a step-by-step walkthrough, see the [Quickstart Guide](docs/quickstart.md).

### As a Template (start a new project)

```bash
gh repo create my-project --template ArtemioPadilla/agent-triforce
cd my-project
claude
```

## Agents

| Agent | Name | Role | Model | Mode |
|-------|------|------|-------|------|
| PM | **Prometeo** | Product specs, business logic, prioritization | Sonnet | Plan (read-only) |
| Dev | **Forja** | Architecture, implementation, testing, docs | Inherit | Accept Edits |
| QA | **Centinela** | Security, code review, compliance, dead code | Sonnet | Default |

## Skills

| Skill | Agent | What it does |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `/feature-spec` | Prometeo | Create a feature specification (tiered: S/M/L) |
| `/implement-feature` | Forja | Implement a feature from its spec (TDD workflow) |
| `/generate-tests` | Forja | Generate tests following FIRST + Arrange-Act-Assert |
| `/review-findings` | Forja | Fix findings from a QA review |
| `/reindex` | Forja | Rebuild codebase knowledge index |
| `/security-audit` | Centinela | Deep OWASP security audit |
| `/code-health` | Centinela | Dead code, tech debt, dependency scan |
| `/release-check` | Centinela | Pre-release verification gate with GO/NO-GO |
| `/traceability` | Centinela | Spec-to-implementation traceability matrix |
| `/checklist-health` | Centinela | Checklist evolution tracking and health report |
| `/simulate-failure` | Centinela | Non-Normal procedure training (fire drills) |

When installed as a plugin, skills are namespaced: `/agent-triforce:feature-spec`, etc.

## Workflow

```
/feature-spec → /implement-feature → /security-audit → /review-findings → repeat
```

```
PM  SIGN IN → spec → TIME OUT → SIGN OUT
  → Dev SIGN IN → implement → TIME OUT → TIME OUT → SIGN OUT
    → QA  SIGN IN → audit → TIME OUT → SIGN OUT
      → Dev SIGN IN → fix → SIGN OUT
        → QA  SIGN IN → verify → SIGN OUT
```

## Methodology

This system applies principles from *The Checklist Manifesto* (Atul Gawande) and Boeing's checklist engineering (Daniel Boorman), structured around the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist.

**Core ideas:**
- **Checklists supplement expertise** — reminders of the most critical steps, not how-to guides
- **FLY THE AIRPLANE** — step 1 of any emergency is to remember your primary mission
- **Three pause points** per agent invocation: **SIGN IN** (before work), **TIME OUT** (mid-workflow verification), **SIGN OUT** (before handoff)
- **Two types**: DO-CONFIRM (verify after work) and READ-DO (step-by-step for handoffs and error recovery)
- **24 checklists, 117 items** across 3 agents. No checklist exceeds 9 items.

## Engineering Principles

Every agent follows established software engineering practices:

- **Specs**: IEEE 830 + INVEST validation, tiered templates (S/M/L), GIVEN/WHEN/THEN acceptance criteria
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture (Robert C. Martin) — dependency rule, screaming architecture, SOLID
- **Development**: TDD Red-Green-Refactor (Kent Beck), Clean Code (<30 line functions, meaningful names, DRY)
- **Testing**: FIRST principles (Fast, Isolated, Repeatable, Self-validating, Timely), Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- **Refactoring**: Fowler's toolkit — Extract Method, Rename, Move, Boy Scout Rule
- **Infrastructure**: 12-Factor App patterns, Gang of Four design patterns

## Key Features

- **Persistent Memory**: Each agent remembers decisions across sessions, with cross-agent conflict detection
- **Auto-formatting**: Dev agent auto-runs ruff/biome after every file edit
- **Permission Enforcement**: PM can't edit code (plan mode), QA is read-only by default
- **Security Scanner**: Pre-commit hook detects hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, XSS patterns
- **System Dashboard**: HTML dashboard auto-generated after every agent session
- **Automated Handoffs**: Structured handoff artifacts generated at every agent boundary
- **Approval Gates**: Formal plan and release gates between agents with audit trail
- **Workflow Tracking**: `/status` command shows current phase, checklists, blockers
- **Session Analytics**: Per-agent token usage, cost estimates, and performance tracking
- **CI/CD Templates**: GitHub Actions workflows for PR review, security audit, release check
- **Codebase Index**: Shared module map with dependency graph, hotspots, and signatures
- **Smart Routing**: Per-skill model selection (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus) with cost estimates
- **Growth Tracking**: Pre-launch readiness gates, milestone-gated actions, weekly metrics log
